# starlight - Exoplanets Trace Simulator
Copyright (c) 2017 Bart Massey

The MMO [EVE Online](http://eveonline.com) is currently
running the second iteration of their
[Project Discovery](https://www.eveonline.com/discovery/)
citizen science project. Project Discovery Exoplanets (PDE)
involves luminance traces measured over a period of about a
month by a European Space Agency satellite. EVE players are
given the opportunity to examine these traces for signs of
planetary occlusion of stars, indicated by one or more "dip"
signatures in a trace.

This work-in-progress tool attempts to give a rough
simulation of these traces, and to test various DSP
techniques for making the dips more visible. Perhaps the
entire process can be automated to give more reliable and
objective results, eliminating the need for "citizen
scientists".

The project is pure Python 3, and is believed to be
cross-platform.

## Status

As of now, luminance traces are being generated and
displayed as a graph similar to (but more sophisticated
than) the one provided in PDE.
